__Expected behaviour:__ [What was expected to happen.]

__Actual behaviour:__ [What actually happened.]

__Additional info:__ [Include debug logging if possible or any other relevant information.]

If what the issue is is not clear, it helps to [enable debug logging](https://github.com/InfluxGraph/influxgraph/blob/master/graphite-api.yaml.example#L16-L23) in InfluxGraph and to provide log output of when the error occured.
